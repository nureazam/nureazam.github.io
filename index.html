                        <p>I, Md.Nur-E-Azam, previously worked as Project Coordinator at the Department of ECE Senior Design Project, <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Real Estate Company Beater Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</a>. <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> of <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">North South University (NSU)</a>.</p>
                        <p>I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from <i>North South University (NSU)</i>. Additionally, I was also one of the Good graduates among the entire 'Graduating Class of 2021'. Before that, I attended the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination from Rajshahi Govt City College.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science, particularly devising a better problem-solving method for intricate tasks. Indeed, it is superfluous to say that data is an essential part of our daily lives in the data-driven era. With that, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as one of the most crucial components to keep pace with the current world. Humongous data is generated every second, and deriving meaning from this ocean of data fascinates me. Due to the growing passion for ML, Data Science, and research, I started my research journey in the biomedical field on '<a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: black;">A Trappy Alpha-Beta and Min-max Search Algorithm in Bangladeshi AI Chess Game</a>' using Artificial intelligence. Later, during the ML course, I had the opportunity to work on '<a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Price Prediction</a>,' where we used various ML algorithms to predict Beater Price. These research works helped me to explore research methodologies more closely and encouraged me to engage deeply in research. Afterward, as my undergraduate thesis, I wanted to explore another prominent domain of ML- Natural Language Processing (NLP), as there has been very little NLP research in Bengali, though it is one of the most extensively spoken languages of the world. Therefore, I did my undergraduate thesis on '<a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Real Estate Company Beater Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</a>,' where we conducted this research-based project in two divisions; one was <a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Bengali Real Estate Company Beater Price Prediction</a>, and the other one was south asian Real Estate Company.</p>
                        <p>Besides my undergraduate studies, I was involved with several organizations, including <a href="http://nsuproblemsolvers.com" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU Problem Solvers (NSUPS)</a>, <a href="https://nsusc.acm.org/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU ACM Student Chapter</a>, and <a href="http://nsusigbedsc.acm.org/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU ACM SIGBED Student Chapter[Founder Member]</a> and <a href="https://vbd.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Volunteer for Bangladesh (VBD)</a>. I started working as a volunteer at VBD, Dhaka division in 2016, which is a non-political volunteer and youth wing of JAAGO. However, involvement with several organizations and working as a volunteer in several social communities significantly polished my interpersonal and social skills.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I am a slightly introverted person who loves to read books of different genres, e.g., thriller, mystery, fantasy, science fiction, classic, etc. Moreover, I invariably try to be contented and to evolve myself every day for the upcoming days with new challenges. Because I always remember the following quote by George Bernard Shaw,</p>
                        <q>Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</q>
